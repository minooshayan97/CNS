1. Make two populations of neurons, an inhibitory population, and an exitatory population of neurons. establish connections between them.
2. consider a noisy input current for each of the target neuron populations.
3. Considering the inputs, show the activity of all three neuron populations over time as a raster plot. Also plot the total activity of all three neuron populations.
4. Repeat the previous experiments with different parameters and communication methods and report their results.
5. Analyze the results of experiments.

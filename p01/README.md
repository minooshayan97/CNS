1. Check out the Pymonnto framework and install and configure it on your system.
2. Implement the LIF, ELIF and AELIF neuron models.
3. As an input to each of these models, consider different currents as a step function (with different intensities) and draw the neuron voltage diagram as well asthe I-F diagram in different states.
4. Also, for the case where the input of the neurons is an arbitrary current with noise (for different amounts of noise), plot their voltage changes.
5. Perform previous experiments for different parameter sets.
6. According to the obtained results, analyze the behavior of different neuron models.

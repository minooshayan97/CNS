1. Consider a black and white image as an input stimulus. Suppose this stimulus will be present for T milliseconds.
2. Implement the Spike-First-to-Time coding method and draw the generated spikes for the input stimulus as a raster plot.
3. Implement the coding method of numerical values and draw the strokes generated for the input stimulus as a raster plot.
4. Suppose that larger numerical values lead to the production of more hits with Gaussian distribution. Implement this coding method and draw the pulses generated for the input stimulus as a raster plot.
5. Use the previous methods to encode different images and report their results.
6. Analyze the results of different coding methods.

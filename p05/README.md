1. Implement STDP unsupervised learning rules or its simpler version STDP-Flat.
2. Implement STDP-R or its simpler version STDP-R-Flat from reinforcement learning rules.
3. Consider a spiking neural network including an input layer and an output layer (including two exitatory neurons). All input neurons are connected to all output neurons.
4. Consider two different patterns of activity with Poisson distribution for the activity of the input neurons and randomly activate one of them as an input each time and train the output neurons using the implemented learning rules.
5. For two output neurons, plot the changes of their synapse weights during the training process (for both types of learning rules).
6. Repeat this experiment for different parameters and report the results.
7. Put the obtained results together and analyze the effect of parameter values in the learning process.

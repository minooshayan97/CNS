1. Implement mechanisms such as All-Take-Winners-k, Lateral inhibition and Homeostasis
2. Build a two-layer spiking neural network, in which the first layer uses the DoG filter to encode the input image, and the second layer contains the feature page, for unsupervised extraction and learning of the features in the input images. . Also, the second layer should have all three mechanisms above.
3. Train the constructed network with a number of natural images as input and draw the extracted features.
4. Repeat the previous test for different parameters and show the results.
5. Put the obtained results together and analyze the effect of parameter values in the feature extraction process.

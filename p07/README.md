1. Implement convolution and pooling communication methods (all parameters are adjustable).
2. Use the filters made in the previous project as the kernel of the Convolution layer and draw the activity of the neurons of that layer for the input black and white image.
3. Then add the Pooling-Max layer to the end of the network and draw the activity of its neurons.
4. Show the previous tests for different parameters.
5. Put the obtained results together and analyze the effect of parameter values on the activity of neurons.

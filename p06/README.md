1. Implement DoG and Gabor filters for two modes: center-on and center-off.
2. Apply the filters made in the previous section on a set of black and white images and output each image and show different results as follows:
(A) In the form of an image where the value of each pixel represents the output of the filter at that point.
(b) Using the Spike-First-to-Time coding method.
(c) Show the output from applying the filters on the images using the Poisson distribution, where the larger the deviation, the higher the number of hits.
3. Put the obtained results together and analyze the effect of parameter values on image coding.

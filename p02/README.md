Using at least one of the neuron models implemented in the previous projects, make one of the following two models:
(a) If you consider the populations of neurons to be the same, then build two populations of homogeneous neurons , one of which contains N × 0.8 excitatory neurons and the other contains N × 0.2 inhibitory neurons (in total Make N neurons).
(b) If you consider the neuron population as heterogeneous, then construct a heterogeneous neuron population consisting of N neurons (80% excitatory neurons and 20% inhibitory neurons).
2. Consider a random input current as the input of neurons and draw the activity of neurons over time as a raster plot. Also plot the activity of the total ͳ population(s) of neuron ͳ.
